# Matlab and Simulink files/code

To run the simulink model the raspberry PI must be ready for ros communications and the workspace/sampling time/washout variables has to be loaded. runModel.m opens up commmunications with the PI and loads the necessary variables. Make sure to keep the workspace.mat file in the same folder.
